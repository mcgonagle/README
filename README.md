This document is work in progress, it's creation has helped me identify and refine my thoughts and values. My hope is that it gives you some insights into how to work with me more effectively. This is not a replacement for actually getting to know each other. I very much value human interaction and look forward to connecting in-person.

## Elevator Pitch
Since childhood, Thomas has prioritized and emphasized human service and has always had a genuine passion for technology. Thomas is adept at recognizing and personally investing in open source market-leading platforms. He uses this insight and his genuine desire for service to help his customers with their most difficult continuous delivery problems.

## Preparedness
 Thomas' personal slogan is *In Omnia Paratus* which means prepared in all things, or "ready for anything". Being organized and ready for anything makes him most comfortable and ready to take on the world. One way this manifests itself is he is a mobile productivity nerd. He carries a large backpack and a small daypack full of everything he needs to get the job done. What ever that job is. It also manifests itself through his need to be prepared for meetings and client engagements. 

 ## Military Family
  Thomas comes from a very military family and this has definitely shaped him. His family has fought and served in every war going back to the [revolutionary war](https://twitter.com/mcgonagle/status/1041192434816962560). He didn't serve, but considers his 7 years working for the FAA as a contractor to be his civil service to the country.  

 ## Professionality 
 Boston is a very reserved business culture. Thomas went to a business focused school for undergraduate and graudate school, and the combination of growing up in Boston and coming up going to Bentley has shaped him. He is most comfortable being formal with customers. With that said, he does strive to create high quality relationships with customers. Thomas is proud to say he has become friends with several customers and sees them socially outside of work. 

## disAbility
Thomas is a disability awareness and activist. He has lead special interest groups at previous employers promoting awareness of disAbility and strives to make every work place as equatable as possible. 

## My values 
Thomas' values were heavily influenced by his experience growing up playing sports and participating in the Boy Scouts. Thomas strives to be the very best teammate he can be, and to live by the Scout Law as an adult.
